abstract = {Equations are developed that can be used to determine the amount of gas present in sea ice from measurements of the bulk ice density, salinity, and temperature in the temperature range of −2 to −30 °C. Conversely these relationships can be used to give the density of sea ice as a function of its temperature and salinity, considering both the presence of gas and of solid salts in the ice. Equations are also given that allow the calculation of the gas and brine volumes in the ice at temperatures other than that at which the bulk density was determined.},

Since its initial release in 2001, SciPy has become a de facto standard for leveraging scientific algorithms in Python, with over 600 unique code contributors, thousands of dependent packages, over 100,000 dependent repositories and millions of downloads per year. In this work, we provide an overview of the capabilities and development practices of SciPy 1.0 and highlight some recent technical developments.},

# Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude oil density measurement
@techreport{Pegau2016,
abstract = {The oil & gas industry has made significant advances in being able to detect, contain and clean up spills in arctic environments. On-going research continues to build upon more than forty years of looking at all aspects of oil spill preparedness, oil spill behaviour and options for oil spill response in the arctic marine environment. This research has included hundreds of studies, laboratory and basin experiments and field trials, specifically in the United States, Canada and Scandinavia.},
